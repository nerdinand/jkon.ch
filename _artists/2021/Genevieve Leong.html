  biography: |
    Genevieve Leong is born in Singapore and now based in Rapperswil. She completed her Bachelor Fine Art at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) in 2015, and her Master Contemporary Art Practice at Royal College of Art (London) in 2019. Her art practice attempts to visualise the intangible. She often combines text, found/made objects and the manipulation of space, seeking to shed new light onto her emotions, sensations and realisations.

  art_description: |
    «Tamper, gently» is a series of adjustable sculptural assemblages that invite viewers to tamper with their positions. In a small booklet, the titles of the assemblages can be found. They function as instructions or suggestions of how to interact with the works, relying on visitors to make decisions on the artist’s behalf. The assemblages remain in a state of constant flux, waiting to be rotated clockwise or anti-clockwise; to be swapped, wheeled, reshuffled.
