  art_description: |
    Stirnimann-Stojanovic’s concepts manifest and materialise through situations, performances, words, and objects. Social issues and structural questions are central themes in their practice. They are interested in testing the boundaries between arts, activism and society. «Art is not a mirror to hold to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it.» (B. Brecht)
