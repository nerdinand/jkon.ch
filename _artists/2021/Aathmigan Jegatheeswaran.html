    Aathmigan Jegatheeswaran is a contemporary artist who lives and works in Zurich, Switzerland. After earning a degree in Mechanical Design from BBW Winterthur, he started with a bachelor's degree in Interaction Design at Zurich University of the Arts. Exploring the vulnerability and its hypocrisy in the consumer-driven way of life primarily through paintings makes up Aathmigan's practice today.
