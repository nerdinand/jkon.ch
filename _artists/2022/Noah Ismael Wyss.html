  art_description: |
    In his artistic practice, Noah explores and transforms constructs and spaces, with a focus on the evolution of humans and their relationship to their environment. Noah creates conceptual and interdisciplinary connections between different systems and translates these results into the physical world.

    From micro to macro,
    from psychological to physical,
    from natural to simulacrum.
