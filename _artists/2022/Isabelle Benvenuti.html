  art_description: |
    Isabelle Benvenuti questions and is interested in what owning a uterus implies in patriarchal capitalism and the societal mechanisms to which this organ is subjected. She approaches this theme through sculpture, illustration, painting or more. This project is a deconstruction of bodies and their environments to such an extent that they form a headless entity.
