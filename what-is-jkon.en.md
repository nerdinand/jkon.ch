The JKON, Young Art Olten, promotes young artists (18-35 years of age) and offers them a platform to show their artwork to the broader public at a three day exhibition. Approximately 15-20 artists exhibit annually at the JKON. 

The granting of an exhibition place is done by an open call and a selection procedure by professionals from the art scene.The award ceremony is held at the finissage. 

It is possible to sell artwork, but this is not the main objective. The artists receive all of any gained money.
