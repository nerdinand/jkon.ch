    The association JKON aims to promote young artists. JKON offers a platform for presenting selected works of art and artistic positions to a wide audience. The exhibition is accompanied by a small supporting program on art and current discourses (talks, guided tours, performances, etc.). The aim is to promote exchange and networking between young artists and visitors as well as with galleries, museums and other art platforms.

    <h2>Our principles</h2>

    <p>
      We work in a participative, reflective, respectful and non-financial way.<br>
      We support young artists.<br>
      We recognize the often precarious conditions in which young artists work and use our scope of action to support their work. All proceeds from works sold go to the participating artists. <br>
      We deliberately work on a voluntary basis, without financial compensation.<br>
      We experiment with different exhibition formats, use available spaces creatively and constantly redesign them.<br>
      We critically reflect on current discourses and ask, among other things, what art should cost the public and what the social position and function of art is and can be.<br>
      We are aware that JKON only exists thanks to the artistic positions of the artists, the sponsorship awards and the organizations that support us.<br>
      We promote the exchange between artists, the public and beyond.<br>
