art_description: My work "Once upon a time" explores how language breaks and changes, depending on who is speaking it. The focus is set on people who read sentences out loud in a language they are not familiar with (japanese or french). First, they listen to a sentence and write down what they hear. Second, they read out loud what they wrote while I record them. Third, a next person listens to the previous recording, takes notes and reads out loud what she*/he* wrote down. This process is repeated several times. Finally, 202 people who are not french-speakers and 86 people who are not japanese-speakers have been recorded.
